# Git

Git is, "a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development." It is used to better organize changes made to a large code base shared by many people, just like our robot code.
Git can take a while to get the hang of. Thankfully, you only need to know a few essential functions to get started with the robot code. If you'd rather learn from a person who knows what they're talking about, explore the following [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) which will teach you Git basics without even coding.
