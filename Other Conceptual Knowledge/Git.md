# Git

Git is, "a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development." It is used to better organize changes made to a large code base shared by many people, just like our robot code.
Git can take a while to get the hang of. Thankfully, you only need to know a few essential functions to get started with the robot code. If you'd rather learn from a person who knows what they're talking about, explore the following [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) which will teach you Git basics without even coding.

## Installation

### Preliminary Info & Operating Systems
Only complete these installation steps if you plan on writing and contributing code from you own machine. If you only use the school machines (will most likely be impossible 2020), or edit through GitHub (not recommended), you do not need to follow these steps.
This section will be written from the point of view of a Windows user, as we currently do not have access to Mac machines. There are most likely many online resources you can use to find out how to install Git on macOS. Git cannot be installed on a school Chromebook.

### Installing
Go to [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which will begin downloading the Windows Git installer.

### Setps & Options
‚ùó*\*Note: many of these steps are general recommendations. If you are an advanced user or programmer, feel free to change some of these steps. Just note that your experience may be slightly different and we may not be able to help completely. An asterisk (\*) will be placed next to mandatory steps.*

- Leave the install location to the default spot.
- Leave the selected components to default. You may add a desktop icon if you wish.
- Leave the start menu folder at default.
- Set the default text editor to Visual Studio Code (or your editor of choice)*
- Select the middle option, "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"*
- Leave the default option "Use the OpenSSL library"
- Leave the line ending conversions to the default option
- Select the default option ("Use MinTTY")
- Leave the extra options on default
- Do not add experimental options

You are now done! You can launch git bash through the start menu (Windows search bar) or the desktop icon if you added it.
