# Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a methodology used to design and implement software solutions. It groups different systems into their own containers, allowing for greater reusability, safety, etc. You won't need to know every detail behind OOP; however, in order to design and maintain good robot code, you need to know the fundamentals.

This section will focus on covering OOP as it relates to the Java programming language. The concepts taught, however, can be applied universally. It is a good idea to have some proficiency in the Java programming language (or another programming language) before coding the robot. Team mentors and leaders will of course help you if you are inexperienced.

## Variables

Variables are simply containers used to store values. Think of them as named boxes that we can fill with things, and later take out the contents of the box.

In Java, a variable can be declared most simply with a data type and a name, such as:

```java
int num;
```

A variable name can be anything, sans a few exceptions you will most likely not run into. Variables can also be assigned values with the = operator. This can happen on the same line as the variable declaration, or on a new line.
